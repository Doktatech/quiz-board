## Description
This is a simple quiz I prepared for my students that i have been teaching HTML,CSS and Javascript. The quiz aims at determining if a student has a clear grasp of the course content before proceeding with next lessons. Consequently, the quiz offers simple yet challenging questions with options to choose from.Thus the "quiz-board " will grade the students accordingly depending on how conversant they are will the content and let them know if they need to retake the course.  Please free free to add to this project and make it more visually appealing
##Installation and Requirements
 
* HTML 5 supportive browser
* NO server needed
*No dependencies.

## Known Bugs
No bugs for the latest update.
## Technologies Used
 The code is well written using HTML5, CSS and Javascript for styling. For full funcionality, we focused on knowing what we wanted to achieve from the students. First, we wanted the quiz to automatically grade the students to a score of 100%. Therefore we established five multiple choice questions with one correct answer. Eventually, when a student selects one answer correct, they will score 20% of the total score.Notheless, if they fail a question a 20% deduction from the total possible score of (100%) is implemented. Therefore, the students score will have a range of 20%.
